## Executive Summary

### What the code does
Thalex Rust SDK is an asynchronous WebSocket client for the Thalex exchange that:
- Supports JSON-RPC requests (request-response)
- Supports channel subscriptions (pub-sub)
- Automatically reconnects on connection loss
- Restores subscriptions after reconnection

### Main bottlenecks

1. **Mutex locks in hot paths** - critical for high message frequency
2. **JSON parsing for every message** - CPU-intensive operation
3. **Excessive string cloning** - unnecessary allocations
4. **No subscription batching** - slow recovery
5. **Fixed reconnection delay** - suboptimal strategy

### Top 3 recommendations

1. **Use DashMap for subscriptions** - eliminates read locks
2. **Subscription batching** - simple optimization with big impact
3. **JSON parsing optimization** - fast key checking before full parsing

## 📝 Reviews and Addendums

During the report preparation process, technical reviews were conducted:

- **[thalex_rust_sdk_perf_addendum.md](./thalex_rust_sdk_perf_addendum.md)** / **[thalex_rust_sdk_perf_addendum_en.md](./thalex_rust_sdk_perf_addendum_en.md)** - additional report with 6 point optimizations (from ChatGPT-5)
- **[thalex_rust_sdk_audit_recheck_report_v2.md](./thalex_rust_sdk_audit_recheck_report_v2.md)** / **[thalex_rust_sdk_audit_recheck_report_v2_en.md](./thalex_rust_sdk_audit_recheck_report_v2_en.md)** - second review with identified inconsistencies (from ChatGPT-5)
- **[thalex_rust_sdk_audit_recheck_report_v3.md](./thalex_rust_sdk_audit_recheck_report_v3.md)** - final review confirming report readiness (from ChatGPT-5)

**Note:** These files contain internal reviews of the report preparation process and may be useful for understanding the evolution of recommendations. Available in Russian and English versions.

## 🔄 Performance Reaudit (2025)

After merging the latest main update and updating rustc, a performance reaudit was conducted:

- **[thalex_rust_sdk_performance_reaudit_2025.md](./thalex_rust_sdk_performance_reaudit_2025.md)** - full performance reaudit report
  - Comparison of benchmark results before and after changes
  - Analysis of new modules (channels, rpc)
  - Updated optimization recommendations
  - Implementation plan for optimizations

## Language Versions

All reports are available in two languages:
- **English** - files with `_en.md` suffix (this document)
- **Russian** - original files without suffix (see [README.md](./README.md))

Both versions contain identical information and structure.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Added benchmark tests for performance measurement
2. ✅ Executed benchmarks and analyzed results
3. ✅ Created final report for client
4. Implement optimizations in priority order (see [FINAL_REPORT_en.md](./FINAL_REPORT_en.md))
5. Re-run benchmarks after optimizations to measure improvements

## Benchmark Results

See [benchmark_results_analysis_en.md](./benchmark_results_analysis_en.md) for detailed analysis of performance results.

**Key findings (updated 2025):**
- ✅ RPC processing: 335 ns (slight degradation +5.7%)
- ⚠️ Ticker processing with subscription: 959 ns (degradation +21.1%)
- 🚨 Concurrent processing of 20 channels: ~1.1 ms (bottleneck persists)
- 🚀 Fast JSON key checking: 44-200x faster than full parsing
