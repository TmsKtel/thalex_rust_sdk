Pass `none` for no grouping.\n- `nlevels` - Number of levels you want to see, or `all`.\n- `delay` - Minimum interval between feeds, possible value is one of `100ms`, `200ms`, `500ms`, `1000ms`, `5000ms`, `60000ms` or `raw`.\n\n\nNotification payload:\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/book.<instrument>.<grouping>.<nlevels>.<delay>_payload\" />\n\n## Ticker\n\nChannel name: `ticker.<instrument>.<delay>`\n\nSubscribes to a ticker feed for a single instrument or a combination.\n\nMark price of a combination is the quantity-weighted sum of mark prices of the leg instruments.\n\nBest bid and best ask for combinations represent top levels of a corresponding virtual combination order book.

The first notification after subscription contains a\nsnapshot of a certain number of last known trades. Subsequent notifications contain new trades. Note that this subscription\nhas a slight delay compared to order book subscriptions (`book.*`), but the snapshot functionality is more reliable.\n\n\nChannel name parameters:\n\n- `target` - Either underlying (e.g. `BTCUSD`), or instrument name (e.g. `BTC-PERPETUAL`).\n- `category` - Category that serves as a filter for which instruments' trades to include in the feed. Can be one of the following values:\n  - `single`: single instrument. Only valid for instrument recent trades. I.e. `recent_trades.BTC-11MAY22-32400-C.single` is valid but `recent_trade.BTCUSD.single` is not valid.\n  - `all`: all instruments in underlying. Only valid for underlying recent trades. I.e. `recent_trades.BTCUSD.all` is valid but `recent_trade.BTC-11MAY22-32400-C.all` is not valid.\n  - `options`: all options in underlying. Only valid for underlying recent trades. I.e. `recent_trades.BTCUSD.options` is valid but `recent_trade.BTC-11MAY22-32400-C.options` is not valid.\n  - `future_rolls`: all combination instruments in underlying that represent rolls between two futures or a future and a perpetual. Only valid for underlying recent trades.

If a future exists with this\nexpiration date, the price equals the future's mark price. Otherwise, if one\nor more options exist with this expiration date, the price will be the\ninterpolated forward price as used in our marking process. If no instrument with\nthis expiration exists, the subscription will fail.\n\n\nChannel name parameters:\n\n- `underlying` - Underlying is e.g. `BTCUSD`.\n- `expiration` - Expiration date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n\n\nNotification payload:\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/base_price.<underlying>.<expiration>_payload\" />\n\n## Instruments\n\nChannel name: `instruments`\n\nSubscribes to changes in active instruments.\n\nNew instruments may be added when others expire, or intraday when the index\nprice changes significantly. Instruments are removed when they expire.\n\nThis subscription immediately responds with a notification for all currently\nactive instruments.\n\n\n\n\nNotification payload:\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/instruments_payload\" />\n\n## Traded RFQs\n\nChannel name: `rfqs`\n\nSubscribed to traded RFQs.

This applies to both source\nand destination accounts.\n\nIf either of the accounts is already in margin breach state, the transfer is only allowed if it results\nin an increase of available margin on that account. The other account must not breach margin requirement\nas a result of the transfer. This allows transferring assets and/or positions\nfrom an account with enough extra margin to an account that was margin called.\n\nEach transfer can contain multiple asset and position transfers. It is checked for margin requirements as a\nsingle transaction. It is possible to specify negative amounts for transferred assets and positions,\nwhich results in a reverse direction of transfer (i.e. from destination account to the source one).\nThis allows performing asset/position exchange operations, and is helpful when a leg of such operation\nalone would result in a margin requirements breach.\n",

Does not perform the transfer itself.\n\nTransfers are subject to margin checks.\n\nA transfer cannot result in an account breaching margin requirements. This applies to both source\nand destination accounts.\n\nIf either of the accounts is already in margin breach state, the transfer is only allowed if it results\nin an increase of available margin on that account. The other account must not breach margin requirement\nas a result of the transfer. This allows transferring assets and/or positions\nfrom an account with enough extra margin to an account that was margin called.\n\nEach transfer can contain multiple asset and position transfers. It is checked for margin requirements as a\nsingle transaction. It is possible to specify negative amounts for transferred assets and positions,\nwhich results in a reverse direction of transfer (i.e. from destination account to the source one).\nThis allows performing asset/position exchange operations, and is helpful when a leg of such operation\nalone would result in a margin requirements breach.\n",
